# Snake and Ladder Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder game in C#.

## Features

- **Board**: The game board consists of cells numbered from 1 to 100.
- **Snakes**: Certain cells on the board have snakes. If a player lands on a cell with the snake's head, they slide down to the cell at the snake's tail.
- **Ladders**: Some cells have ladders. If a player lands on a cell with the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to the cell at the top of the ladder.
- **Players**: The game supports multiple players who take turns rolling a die and moving accordingly on the board.
- **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed the final cell (100) wins the game.
